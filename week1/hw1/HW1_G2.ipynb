To add to that discussion, it also enables for relative comparison of how green and dirty firms perform over time, which is more in line with how investors would make their investment decisions rather than some arbitrary number that doesn't fully capture a firm's overall risk exposure to ESG issues.</span>\n"

What they noted in their 2021 paper was that the green stocks should have a lower expected return as investors who buy them often make their decisions on measures of utility that include more than just the expected profitability. They reconcile this supposed flaw with a wider discussion about expected versus realized returns and note that even though we saw over the sample period that greener firms had a very high realized return, it does does disappear when you control for other factors, like environmental concern.</span>\n",

    "<span style=\"color:#406A5F\">This is because even though realized returns are often used as a proxy for expected returns, they can often diverge as not only are there other proxies for expected returns, but there are other factors that should be controlled for that is missing in the usual assumptions for using realized returns as expected returns. Additionally, they note strange behaviour in price adjustment in large versus small firms, where small-cap firms tend to underreact to envronmental news, which suggests that green investing is not spread evenly. Overall, they are careful to note that their findings indicate this period of outperformance should not be interpreted to suggest that green firms should expect higher returns, and instead that these returns are driven by other factors.</span>\n"

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">The **Sharpe ratio** measures the risk-adjusted performance of an investment or portfolio. It considers not only the returns generated but also the level of risk taken to achieve those returns.</span> <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<span style=\"color:purple\">**Top Sharpe Ratio Industries:** <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Meals**: The returns from this industry were not only high but were achieved with relatively lower risk. Possible reasons could include stable demand for food-related products.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Smoke**: This industry, which likely includes tobacco companies, also shows a high Sharpe ratio. This could be due to the relatively stable and consistent demand for tobacco products, which can lead to steady cash flows and returns.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Guns**: The firearms industry has a high Sharpe ratio, indicating that it offered strong risk-adjusted returns. This may be linked to factors such as political events, concerns about personal safety, and changes in gun regulations, which could drive demand for firearms.<br></span>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">\n",
    "**Bottom Sharpe Ratio Industries**:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Books**: This industry has the lowest Sharpe ratio among the listed industries. This suggests that the returns generated by this industry were relatively low compared to the level of risk taken. The decline of traditional print publishing due to the rise of digital media might have contributed to this lower risk-adjusted performance.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Coal**: The coal industry's low Sharpe ratio reflects the challenges faced by this sector during the period. Factors like environmental concerns, the shift towards cleaner energy sources, and reduced demand for coal likely contributed to both lower returns and higher risk.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Gold**: Gold, which is traditionally considered a safe-haven asset, had the second-lowest Sharpe ratio. This may be due to a combination of lower returns compared to equities and the relatively low risk associated with gold investments during this period.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In comparing the rankings based on cumulative monthly returns and Sharpe ratios, we can see that industries like Guns, Books, and Gold are in a similar extreme end of the spectrum. </span>\n"

We found the following news articles that might be the reason for the spike in Google searches for climate change.<br>1. The April 2022 global surface temperature was 0.85°C (1.53°F) above the 20th century average and tied with 2010 as the fifth highest for April in the 143-year record. - https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/202204#:~:text=The%20April%202022%20global%20surface,in%20the%20143%2Dyear%20record <br> </span>\n",
