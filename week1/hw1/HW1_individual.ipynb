    ">In Section IV of the study, the authors looked at how being socially responsible helped companies during tough financial times. They found that companies that really care about social issues did better in terms of profits, sales, and how productive their employees were. Also, these socially responsible companies found it a bit easier to borrow money during the crisis. Why does this matter? Well, during hard times, people and other businesses tend to trust and want to work with companies they believe are doing good in the world. So, these \"good guy\" companies had a bit of an edge during the rough patch because they had built up a good reputation.<br><br>\n",

    ">>CSR can help to reduce a firm's risk profile. Firms with high CSR ratings are often seen as being more stable and less likely to engage in risky behavior. This can make them more attractive to both customers and investors.\n",
